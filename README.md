![# My Cute Gay Ass Theme](./marketing/marketing.png)
Some changes I've made to [TakosThings' FluentDiscord theme.](https://github.com/TakosThings/Fluent-Discord)

<!> <br/>
***Currently broken due to Discord's update, almost all themes are!*** <br/>
***Waiting on TakosThings to update their theme*** <br/>
<!> <br/>

# Installation/Configuration (Vencord/BD)
You can download the theme [here](./fluent.theme.css) and place it in your themes folder _(on Vencord too!).

In order to configure it, you can just open it up and tweak stuff.

You can additionally paste the content of [fluent.theme.css](./fluent.theme.css) inside your QuickCSS, instead of your themes folder.

View all the settings [here](https://github.com/TakosThings/Fluent-Discord/wiki/Options) alright goodbye thank you ヾ(＠⌒ー⌒＠)ノ

# Keep in mind
- This is an edit of FluentDiscord, that theme belongs to [TakosThings.](https://github.com/TakosThings)
  I haven't made most of the theme, but I've made some custom elements to improve it
- My theme is built on top of FluentDiscord using a CSS `@import`, when it receives any updates, so will this theme
- This theme is mainly built for Vencord, i havent tested it on BD
- Some things might be inconsistent, feel free to [open up an issue.](../../issues/new)
  I currently daily-drive this theme however, so anything thats too annoying will definitely get patched

# Plugin support
Currently, I've made an effort to add support for the following Vencord plugins:
- ReadAllNotificationsButton

Vencord plugins that aren't listed here should still work, if they don't, please [open up an issue](../../issues/new)
