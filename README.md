# Fluent Theme But Slightly Better
Some changes I've made to [TakosThings' FluentDiscord theme.](https://github.com/TakosThings/Fluent-Discord)

# Configuration (Vencord/BD)
If you want to replace my hella gay Owl House wallpaper _(dont know why you'd do that)_ use the following:
```css
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlooferLand/DiscordFluentTheme/main/fluent.theme.css);

:root {
	/* Pick another accent colour here - https://takosthings.github.io/Fluent-Discord/color.html */
	--fluent-accent-hue-sat: 307, 55%;
	--fluent-accent-lightness: 49%;
	--fluent-text-on-accent-color: 0, 0, 0;

	/* Ignore the gay */
	--fluent-acrylic-background: url(https://images2.alphacoders.com/129/1291151.png);
	--fluent-acrylic-background-blur: 2px;
	--fluent-acrylic-background-dimness: 60%;
	--fluent-acrylic-background-saturate: 50%;
	--fluent-guilds-icon-size: 44px;
}
```
### In Vencord, just paste that into your QuickCSS page. Could probably do the same for BD
Also view all the settings [here](https://github.com/TakosThings/Fluent-Discord/wiki/Options) alright goodbye thank you ヾ(＠⌒ー⌒＠)ノ

# Keep in mind
- This is an edit of FluentDiscord, that theme belongs to [TakosThings.](https://github.com/TakosThings)
  I haven't made most of the theme, but I've made some custom elements to improve it
- My theme is built on top of FluentDiscord, when it receives any updates, so will this theme
- This theme is mainly build for Vencord, i havent tested it on BD
